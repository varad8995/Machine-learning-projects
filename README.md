 I have a health insurance dataset(CSV file) with customer information on insurance charges, age, sex, BMI, etc. We have to predict insurance charges based on these parameters in the dataset. This is a regression problem as our target variable — Charges/insurance cost — is numeric.
## Data Description
age: age of primary beneficiary

sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

smoker: Smoking

region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Workflow

1. Data collection
2. Data analysis
3. Data processing
4. Test train split
5. Linear regression model
6. Trained linear regression model
